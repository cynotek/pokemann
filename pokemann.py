        The logic of a Pokefight

         1) Player selects a move (how is player connected to Pokemann?)
         2) Other selects random move.
         3) Speed is checked. Player with higher speed goes first.
         4) First attack executed. Some formula needs to be devised to determine damage.
         5) Check for death.
         6) Second attack executed (if alive).
         7) Check for death.
         8) Repeat until one Pokemann is dead. (Does the next one in line move up?)

         What happens when all of a player's Pokemann are dead? Is that the end of the game?
